   * start time on every request that has to pay it.

   * Safe because the branch that imports it is unreachable in production:
   * `lib/db.ts` raises a configuration error when `DATABASE_URL` is unset rather
   * than falling back, so a deployment either has Postgres or serves no requests
   * at all. Local `next start` is unaffected — tracing decides what gets copied

   * exactly the shape a shared cache gets wrong.
   *
   * Declared here rather than in the page because a Server Component cannot set a
   * response header — and because a rule about which URLs are private belongs
   * somewhere it can be read in one place.

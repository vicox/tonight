 * The database this deployment uses, opened once.
 *
 * One connection for everything stored here. There are two independent schemas
 * — the OAuth flow state and the user's own taste model — and they
 * are kept apart by their tables and their migrations, not by each opening its
 * own pool. A pool per schema would double the connections every instance holds
 * against a managed Postgres for no benefit, which is the sort of thing that
 * only shows up once several instances are running.
 *
 * Cached as a promise rather than a value so that concurrent first requests
 * share one pool instead of racing to build their own — but only once it has
 * resolved. A rejected promise is forgotten, because caching one would turn a
 * single transient failure into a permanently broken instance: a database that
 * was briefly waking up, or a pool that timed out on the very first request,
 * would poison every request afterwards until the instance happened to be
 * recycled.
 *
 * `ConfigurationError` comes from the OAuth configuration module because that is
 * where this deployment's configuration lives; the error means the same thing
 * here — something the operator has to fix, answered as a server fault rather
 * than blamed on the client.

 * Google as the identity provider: the only file that knows Google exists.
 *
 * Everything Google-shaped is behind this module's two functions — its
 * endpoints, the OpenID Connect identity token, the keys that sign one, the
 * claim the subject lives in. What leaves is an `AuthenticatedUser`, so the rest
 * of the OAuth layer stays provider-agnostic and a second provider is a sibling
 * file rather than a change here.
 *
 * Note what is *not* asked for. The scope is `openid email`: enough to learn that
 * a real Google account authenticated, which one it was, and the address needed
 * to answer whether it is on this deployment's access list. `profile` is one word
 * away and deliberately not requested — a name and a picture would tell
 * Tonight nothing it needs, and data that is never collected cannot leak.
 *
 * The address leaves this module only as far as the seam in `provider.ts`, which
 * asks the access list about it. For an MCP client's authorization it is dropped
 * there and goes no further. For a website sign-in it travels one step more, into
 * the browser-session row that the site reads to say which Google account it
 * is showing — and out again when that session ends. No token and no MCP result
 * ever carries it.

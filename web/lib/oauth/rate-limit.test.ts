/**
 * How a caller is turned into a bucket, and whose word is taken for who they are.
 *
 * Three properties, and they pull against each other, which is why they are
 * written down:
 *
 *   1. the limiter needs one caller to land in one bucket every time
 *   2. the row it writes must not say which caller that was — the bucket is a
 *      primary key in `oauth_rate_limits`, so it is the record of who visited
 *   3. **nothing a request carries may buy the sender a bucket of their own**
 *
 * The third is the one with an attacker in it. A request header is written by
 * whoever sends the request, so a limiter that identifies callers by reading one
 * has as many identities as the sender cares to type — and a rate limit with
 * unlimited identities is not a rate limit. The answer here is not a different
 * header: it is that a header is only believed where the platform is documented to
 * have overwritten it, and `process.env.VERCEL` — an environment variable the
 * platform sets, not something a request can carry — is how that is known.
 *
 * Both modes are exercised below, because both ship: the trusted one is
 * production, and the shared one is a laptop, a self-hosted box, or anything with
 * a proxy in front that this reasoning does not cover.

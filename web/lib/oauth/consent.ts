/**
 * The consent page, and why there is one.
 *
 * This server holds a single registered application with the identity provider
 * — one static client id, shared by every MCP client that registers here. That
 * is what makes a consent step mandatory rather than polite. The provider
 * remembers a user's approval of *our* application, so once one user has
 * approved it, a later forward to the provider can complete from their existing
 * session without showing them anything. An attacker who registered their own
 * client and redirect URI could then walk a logged-in user through this endpoint
 * and collect an authorization code, in silence.
 *
 * The MCP authorization specification's security considerations require exactly
 * this mitigation of it: a server using a static client id **MUST** obtain user
 * consent for each dynamically registered client before forwarding to a
 * third-party authorization server. The page below is that consent, and the
 * approval it collects is the only thing that starts the forward.
 *
 * It is intentionally plain HTML with inline styles, served straight from the
 * route. It is not part of the Tonight application: it borrows nothing from
 * its layout, its fonts or its components, so nothing about the product's own
 * pages can change what a security prompt looks like — or be changed by it.

/**
 * The page a refusal is handed back to the client through.
 *
 * A refusal has to reach the client as `access_denied` at its own redirect URI,
 * and that URI is on somebody else's origin — registered dynamically, by anyone.
 * Answering the approval form with a redirect straight there is the obvious
 * shape, and it is the one Chrome refuses: it checks `form-action` against the
 * URL a form submission *lands* on, so a client origin would have to be in the
 * consent page's policy for a refusal to complete. Putting it there would mean a
 * caller naming its own origin in the policy of the page that collects
 * approvals, which is precisely what that policy exists to stop.
 *
 * So the refusal lands here instead — same origin, allowed by `'self'` — and the
 * journey to the client is a second navigation that the form did not perform. A
 * `meta refresh` is not a form submission and no CSP directive governs it, which
 * is the whole reason this page exists rather than a redirect. It needs no script,
 * which matters because `default-src 'none'` would refuse one.
 *
 * ## Why that is not an open redirect
 *
 * The destination is not read from this request. It is built in the caller from
 * the redirect URI that was validated against the client's registration before
 * the consent page was ever shown, and it is spent along with the pending login —
 * there is no parameter here, no endpoint to point somewhere else, and nothing a
 * visitor can vary. The `state` inside it is the client's own, percent-encoded by
 * `URLSearchParams` and escaped again for the attribute it sits in.
 *
 * The host shown to the reader is taken from that same URL, so what the page says
 * and where it goes cannot disagree.
 *
 * The link is a fallback, for a browser or a setting where meta refresh does not
 * fire. Without it a refusal would be a dead end rather than an answer.

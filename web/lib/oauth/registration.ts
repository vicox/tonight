/**
 * Dynamic Client Registration, per RFC 7591.
 *
 * How an MCP client that has never met this server gets a client id: it posts
 * its redirect URIs and receives one, with no human registering anything in
 * advance. That is what lets a client be handed a bare URL and complete a flow,
 * and it is why the endpoint is open — an unauthenticated POST is the whole
 * point of the mechanism, and requiring pre-registration would defeat it.
 *
 * Open, but not unguarded: what is accepted is decided in `clients.ts`, and a
 * client id grants nothing on its own. It names where an authorization code may
 * be delivered, and a code is worthless without both a user approving the
 * client and the PKCE verifier only the client that began the flow holds.
 *
 * The current MCP specification marks RFC 7591 deprecated in favour of Client
 * ID Metadata Documents, while keeping it available for authorization servers
 * that do not implement them. The deprecated mechanism is implemented here on
 * purpose: it is the one every MCP client in the field speaks today, and
 * offering only the newer one would leave this endpoint unreachable in practice.

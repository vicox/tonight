/**
 * Who is allowed to sign in to this deployment.
 *
 * A private beta needs a way to say "these people, nobody else yet", and the
 * smallest honest way to say it is a list of addresses in the environment. There
 * is no users table behind this and it is not an account model: it is one
 * question — may this person authenticate at all — asked once, at the moment the
 * identity provider has established who they are and before Tonight has
 * issued anything.
 *
 * ## The address is not the identity
 *
 * The email decides *access*. The Google subject remains the identity, and it is
 * the only thing that leaves this layer. That split matters because the two
 * properties are different: a subject is stable and survives someone changing
 * their address, which is what a storage key needs; an address is what a human
 * can be told to put on a list. Using the address as the key would mean a beta
 * tester who renames their Google account loses their taste model.
 *
 * Nothing here reaches a token or an MCP client. The address is read from the
 * identity token, used to answer one boolean, and dropped — with one exception,
 * stated where it happens: a website sign-in keeps it on the browser-session row,
 * because the site names the account whose taste model it is showing and because this question
 * is then re-asked on every request of that session. See `lib/web/store.ts`.
 *
 * ## In production, no list means nobody
 *
 * A closed beta must not become public because a variable was renamed, blanked, or
 * lost on the way into an environment. So in production an unset, empty or
 * whitespace-only `ALLOWED_EMAILS` is a `ConfigurationError`: the deployment
 * refuses the requests that need it and says why in its log, exactly as it does
 * for a missing signing secret or a missing database. Nobody is admitted, which is
 * the only safe reading of "there is no list of who may come in".
 *
 * Refusing rather than answering "you are not on the list" is deliberate. There is
 * no list, so that answer would be a lie told to somebody who might well be
 * invited, and it would leave the operator with a working-looking deployment that
 * nobody can use and nothing to say why. A configuration fault names the cause in
 * the place the operator can read.
 *
 * ## Outside production, no list means everyone
 *
 * A local checkout has to work after `npm install` without a list to maintain, and
 * a developer signing in to their own machine is not an access-control question.
 * That convenience is explicitly bounded to non-production: it is not "empty means
 * everyone" as a rule with an exception, it is a development affordance that
 * production does not have.
 */

/**
 * Somebody who authenticated successfully and still may not come in.
 *
 * Its own type, separate from a failure to verify, because they are different
 * answers to different questions and the person in front of the browser deserves
 * to be told which one they got. Being told "your account is not on the list" is
 * useful and gives nothing away — they already know their own address.

 * function: in production it is a fault, and outside it is an open door. Null is
 * therefore only ever returned outside production.
 *
 * Read per call rather than at module load, so an operator who fixes the variable
 * in a dashboard does not have to wait for a process to be recycled.

 * The ceilings on the endpoints anyone may call, and who they are counted

 *
 * Three endpoints are open by necessity rather than by choice. Registration has to
 * be, because dynamic registration is how a client that has never met this server
 * gets an id at all; the authorization endpoint and the website's sign-in have to
 * be, because both are things a browser reaches before anyone knows who is
 * visiting. All three therefore write to the database on behalf of callers who
 * have proved nothing, and a ceiling is the only thing between that and a table
 * that grows for as long as someone keeps asking.
 *
 * These limits are not a correctness mechanism and must not become one. Every
 * caller treats a refusal as "later", never as "invalid", and nothing downstream
 * assumes a request got through because it was allowed to.
 *
 * Registration has a second bound that does not depend on any of this: a client
 * nobody has used for ninety days is deleted. See `CLIENT_RETENTION_MS` in
 * `store.ts` — a ceiling on rate only decides how fast a table grows, and that is
 * what decides how large it gets.

/**

 *
 * ## The trust assumption, stated
 *
 * `X-Forwarded-For` is a request header, and a request header is written by
 * whoever sends the request. Reading one and treating its value as an identity is
 * how a limiter gets handed as many identities as an attacker cares to type.
 *
 * On Vercel it is safe, and for a documented reason rather than a hopeful one:
 * Vercel's ingress **overwrites** `X-Forwarded-For` with the connecting client's
 * address and does not forward an external value, explicitly so that the header
 * cannot be spoofed (vercel.com/docs/headers/request-headers). The value that
 * reaches a function is therefore the platform's own observation, not the
 * caller's claim.
 *
 * That guarantee is about *Vercel's* ingress, so it only holds when this is
 * actually running behind it. `process.env.VERCEL` is how that is known: it is an
 * environment variable the platform sets, not a header a request carries, so
 * nothing a caller sends can turn the trust on. Anywhere else — a laptop, a
 * self-hosted box, a proxy somebody put in front — there is no established value
 * and this returns null.
 *
 * Two things this deliberately does not do. It does not read
 * `x-vercel-forwarded-for`: that header is documented as the one to use when a
 * proxy of your own sits on top of Vercel, and there is no published statement
 * that a client-supplied copy is stripped, so trusting it here would be inventing
 * a guarantee. And it does not take the left-most entry of a list. Vercel writes a
 * single address; a comma means something is in front of the ingress that this
 * reasoning did not account for, so the value is not the one the guarantee is
 * about and is refused rather than parsed. An attacker who sends a list gets the
 * shared bucket, which is a tighter limit than their own, not a looser one.
 *
 * Deliberately not exported. The address identifies a person, and the only thing
 * this module does with it is derive the bucket below — so keeping it private is
 * what makes "the raw address does not leave here" a property of the code rather
 * than a habit of its callers.

/**
 * The bucket a request is counted in: a namespace, and who the caller is.
 *
 * The caller is identified by an HMAC of their address rather than the address
 * itself, because this value is a primary key in `oauth_rate_limits` and
 * therefore the one place a rate limit would otherwise leave a plaintext record
 * of who visited. Counting is all the limiter needs, and counting only needs the
 * same caller to land in the same bucket — which a digest does exactly as well
 * as an address.
 *
 * Keyed, not a bare hash. The space of IPv4 addresses is small enough to
 * enumerate completely, so a plain digest of one is reversible by anyone holding
 * the table; an HMAC is not, without the key. The same reasoning and the same
 * construction as `userRef` in `lib/identity.ts`, and the key is taken as an
 * argument for the same reason: a caller that has one has been through the
 * configuration check, and this module never reads the environment.
 *
 * When no address has been established, every caller shares one bucket. That is
 * the conservative direction: an unknown caller gets a *tighter* limit than a
 * known one, never a private one of their own, so there is no value anybody can
 * send that buys them more room. It also means a deployment that is not behind a
 * trusted ingress limits everybody together, which is the honest consequence of
 * not knowing who is asking — and it is a limit on availability rather than a hole
 * in a control, which is the right way for this to fail.
 *
 * `kind` keeps the open endpoints counting separately, so a client registering
 * does not spend a person's authorization budget. It stays in the clear: it names
 * an endpoint, not a caller, and a readable prefix is what makes a row in that
 * table diagnosable at all.

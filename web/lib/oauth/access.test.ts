/**
 * Who may sign in to this deployment.
 *
 * Two questions, asked in order and easy to conflate. The first is whether Google
 * established an address at all — an unverified one is not evidence of anything,
 * because it is an address the account holder typed rather than proved. The second
 * is whether that address is on the list this deployment was configured with.
 *
 * The invariant running through all of it: the address decides access and the
 * subject decides identity. A test that found an address where a user id belongs
 * would be finding a bug.
 *
 * And one asymmetry, which is the third section below: what "no list" means
 * depends on where this runs. On a laptop it is an open door, because a developer
 * signing in to their own machine is not an access-control question. In production
 * it is a fault, because a closed beta must not become public by way of a variable
 * that was renamed, blanked, or lost on the way into an environment.

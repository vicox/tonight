/**
 * Where the identity provider returns the user, and where the flow rejoins the
 * client's own.
 *
 *     provider ─► /oauth/callback ─► authorization code ─► client's redirect_uri
 *
 * The parked request is what makes that join safe. Everything used to build the
 * response — which client, which redirect URI, which code challenge, which
 * `state` to echo — is read from the record parked before the user left, never
 * from this request's own query string. The provider returns two things and two
 * only: an authorization code of its own, and the reference that finds the
 * record.
 *
 * And the record is not found by that reference alone. It was parked bound to a
 * value this browser holds as a cookie, and the binding is matched by the same
 * statement that spends the reference — so a `state` that reaches a *different*
 * browser finds nothing and consumes nothing. Without that, the Google URL an
 * approval produces would be enough on its own to collect a code for whichever
 * account the browser opening it happens to be signed in to, which would join one
 * person's approval to another person's identity. See flow-binding.ts.

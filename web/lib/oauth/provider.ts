/**
 * The seam between this authorization server and whatever authenticates the

 *
 * Tonight issues its own tokens for its own MCP endpoint — that part is
 * ours and stays ours, because it is what binds a token to a resource we own.
 * Who the user *is*, though, is a question we have no business answering
 * ourselves: it would mean passwords, resets and a mail path, none of which
 * Tonight wants to own. So the flow steps aside for exactly one round
 * trip, and comes back with an identity.
 *
 * The interface exists so the rest of the OAuth layer never learns which
 * provider answered. It hands out a redirect and takes back an
 * `AuthenticatedUser`; everything in between — the shape of the identity token,
 * whose keys signed it, which claim holds the subject — lives inside the
 * implementation. Adding a second provider is a second file and a branch in
 * `identityProvider`, and nothing else moves.

/**
 * What a provider establishes about the person who signed in.
 *
 * Two things, and only one of them travels further. `user` is the identity —
 * stable, opaque, the thing that decides whose taste model this is. `email` is
 * an attribute used to answer one question, at the seam below, and then dropped:
 * it is never stored, never in a token, and never visible to an MCP client.
 *
 * They are separate fields rather than one because they are not the same
 * property. An address is what a person can be told to put on an access list; a
 * subject is what survives them changing that address.

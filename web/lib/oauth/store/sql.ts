/**
 * The OAuth store in SQL, written once for anything that speaks Postgres.
 *
 * Everything here is single-use, and the whole durability argument is about how
 * a thing gets spent exactly once. There are two shapes, and which one applies
 * depends on whether spending it involves a decision.
 *
 * **Nothing to decide: one statement.** A parked login is resumed with
 *
 *     DELETE FROM … WHERE hash = $1 AND expires_at > $2 AND binding … RETURNING …
 *
 * The row is located, checked for expiry, matched against its browser binding,
 * removed and returned indivisibly. Two requests presenting the same reference —
 * on two instances, in the same millisecond — cannot both come away with it: the
 * database serialises them on the row, the first gets the returned row, the
 * second matches nothing. A read followed by a delete would look equivalent and
 * would not be; the window between the two is exactly the replay this removes.
 *
 * **Something to decide: lock, decide, then spend.** An authorization code and a
 * refresh token both carry constraints that the request has to satisfy — which
 * client, which redirect URI, which verifier, which resource, which scope — and
 * those cannot be expressed as a WHERE clause without teaching this file the
 * protocol. Deciding them *after* a `DELETE … RETURNING` would mean a request
 * that was never going to succeed had already consumed somebody's credential on
 * its way to being refused. So instead:
 *
 *     SELECT … WHERE hash = $1 FOR UPDATE     -- located and locked, nothing spent
 *     …expiry, replay, and the caller's own check…
 *     DELETE / UPDATE … INSERT successor      -- only now, in the same transaction
 *
 * `FOR UPDATE` is what makes the gap safe. A concurrent spend of the same row
 * blocks at the SELECT until this transaction ends, and then sees what happened
 * rather than racing past it — a deleted code as absent, a spent refresh token as
 * spent. Exactly one caller gets through, and a refusal costs the holder nothing.
 *
 * The two consume differently, on purpose. A code is deleted, so a second
 * presentation simply finds nothing. A refresh token is *marked* spent and its
 * successor inserted in the same transaction, because a deleted row cannot tell
 * the difference between a token that never existed and one that was already
 * used — and that difference is what makes replay detectable, and the family
 * revocable when it is detected.
 *
 * There is no application-level lock anywhere in this file, and no advisory lock:
 * the row is the only thing anything waits on.
 *
 * Expiry is checked on every read, which is why cleanup can never be
 * load-bearing: a row past `expires_at` is refused whether or not anything has
 * got round to deleting it.
 */

/**
 * The schema, as ordered migrations.
 *
 * SQL lives in this file rather than in `.sql` files on disk on purpose: a route
 * handler may be bundled or run somewhere with no filesystem to read, and a
 * migration that cannot be found at runtime is a migration that silently does not
 * run. Inline strings are always where the code is.
 *
 * One migration, because Tonight has never been deployed and no database exists
 * that needs walking forward from an older shape. Append to this list; never edit
 * an entry that has shipped. A version already recorded is never re-run, so
 * changing one would leave two deployments disagreeing about what the schema is.
 *
 * There are no foreign keys from a grant to its client, and that is a choice
 * rather than an omission. The tables have opposite lifetimes — a registration is
 * permanent, a grant lives for a minute — and nothing deletes a client, so a key
 * would only add a cascade nobody triggers. Which client a grant belongs to is
 * validated by the protocol layer before the row is written, and checked again
 * when it is spent.

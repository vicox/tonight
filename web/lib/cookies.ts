/**
 * How this deployment writes and reads a cookie — one set of rules, for every
 * cookie it sets.
 *
 * There are four of them, in two families, and they are all the same kind of
 * thing: an unguessable value that binds one step of a flow, or one session, to
 * the browser holding it. None carries information. The value is a lookup key
 * whose row holds the meaning, so there is nothing in a cookie to read, tamper
 * with or decode — which is why none of them is signed. A signature protects a
 * value a client is trusted to carry back with meaning intact, and these carry
 * none.
 *
 *     tn_consent_<flow>   an MCP client's approval, bound to the browser shown it
 *     tn_provider_<flow>  the Google leg after that approval, same browser
 *     tn_login_<flow>     a website sign-in in progress
 *     tn_session          a signed-in browser
 *
 * Centralised here rather than written out per cookie because the attributes are
 * the security properties. A cookie that got one of them wrong would look
 * identical to one that did not, and there would be no single place to check.
 *
 * ## `__Host-` in production
 *
 * Every cookie name is prefixed with `__Host-` unless the deployment is loopback.
 * A browser refuses to store a cookie so named unless it is `Secure`, has
 * `Path=/` and carries no `Domain` — and, crucially, refuses to store one *set by
 * a different host*, which is what makes the prefix worth having. Without it a
 * compromised sibling subdomain can set `Domain=tonight.movie; <our name>=…`
 * and the browser will present it alongside ours on every request; with it, that
 * cookie cannot be created at all. The prefix is a property the browser enforces,
 * where "we never set `Domain`" is only a property of our own code.
 *
 * It is dropped on loopback because the prefix requires `Secure` and a browser
 * rejects a `Secure` cookie over plain http, which would leave local development
 * unable to sign in at all. Both the writing and the reading of a name go through
 * `cookieName`, so the two can never disagree about which form is in use.
 *
 * `Path=/` on all four follows from the prefix. It is wider than the `/oauth` and
 * `/auth` paths two of them strictly need, and that is the trade: a cookie sent on
 * requests that ignore it costs nothing, while a cookie a subdomain can forge
 * costs a flow.
 *
 * ## Duplicates are refused rather than resolved
 *
 * A `Cookie` header carrying the same name twice is ambiguous, and the ambiguity
 * is exactly what cookie tossing produces. Picking the first, or the last, would
 * be choosing which of two credentials to honour on a rule the attacker also
 * knows. So two cookies of one name read as none, the flow fails closed, and the
 * remedy — clear the cookies and start again — is one the person can perform.

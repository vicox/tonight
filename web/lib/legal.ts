/**
 * Who operates this deployment, for the pages that are legally required to say.
 *
 * The values are configuration rather than source, for one reason: they are a
 * private individual's name and home address. A repository is public, cloned and
 * mirrored; an environment variable is entered once in the host's dashboard and
 * appears in no diff. The legal *texts* stay in source, because they are the
 * operator's statements and belong under review like any other change — only the
 * identity behind them is configured.
 *
 * ## An incomplete configuration yields no page, not a page with gaps
 *
 * `§ 5 DDG` and Art. 13 GDPR require a real name and an address at which the
 * operator can be served. A page missing either is not a lesser disclosure, it is
 * a false one: it looks like the required statement while naming nobody. So the
 * pages that depend on these values answer `404` when they are unset, which is
 * the honest answer — the disclosure does not exist yet — and it is impossible
 * for a placeholder, an empty line or the word "undefined" to reach a reader.

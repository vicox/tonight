/**
 * The website's two cookies: a sign-in in progress, and a signed-in browser.
 *
 * How they are written — `HttpOnly`, `__Host-` in production, `Secure` off
 * loopback only, `Path=/`, and a duplicate name read as no cookie at all — is
 * `lib/cookies.ts`, which is the same set of rules the OAuth flow's bindings use.
 * What is here is which cookies exist, what each one is for, and the two choices
 * that differ between them.
 *
 * ## SameSite=Lax on both, and Strict would break both
 *
 * Both are presented on a **top-level navigation arriving from Google**, which is
 * a cross-site context: with `Strict` the browser sends neither, so a sign-in
 * could never complete and a completed one would look signed-out on arrival at
 * the home page. `Lax` sends a cookie on exactly that navigation and withholds it
 * from cross-site form posts and subresource requests — which is the half that
 * matters, because the one state-changing request here is signing out.
 *
 * (The consent binding under `/oauth` keeps `Strict`, because it is presented by a
 * form posting to the origin that served it. The difference is the flow, not a
 * difference of opinion about safety.)
 *
 * ## One login cookie per sign-in, one session cookie per browser
 *
 * The login cookie's name carries the sign-in it belongs to, the way the OAuth
 * flow's bindings do. A single name would make two sign-ins in one browser
 * mutually exclusive — a second tab would overwrite the first tab's cookie, and a
 * callback answering either would clear the other's — so opening the sign-in twice
 * would leave a flow that can no longer complete, and, worse, a mismatched or
 * stale callback would destroy a *valid* pending sign-in it has nothing to do
 * with. Naming each cookie after its own `state` makes concurrent sign-ins
 * independent: each is cleared on its own, and a callback can only ever affect the
 * flow whose `state` it carries.
 *
 * The session cookie has one name, because a browser has one session. Signing in
 * again replaces it, which is what switching Google account has to mean.

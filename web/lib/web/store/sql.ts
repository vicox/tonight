/**
 * The browser-session store in SQL.
 *
 * Two tables, and only one of them holds anything spent exactly once. A parked
 * sign-in is resumed with
 *
 *     DELETE FROM web_logins WHERE hash = $1 AND expires_at > $2 AND binding = $3 RETURNING …
 *
 * so the row is located, checked for expiry, matched against the browser that
 * started the sign-in, removed and returned indivisibly. Two requests presenting
 * the same `state` cannot both come away with it: the database serialises them on
 * the row, the first gets the returned row, the second matches nothing. A read
 * followed by a delete would look equivalent and would not be.
 *
 * A session needs none of that. It is presented many times rather than once, so
 * reading it is a plain indexed probe with the expiry in the WHERE clause, and
 * ending it is a plain delete. There is nothing to decide and therefore nothing
 * to lock.
 *
 * Both tables are keyed by the SHA-256 of the value the browser holds, never the
 * value: a copy of this database is not a set of working sessions. Whoever reads
 * it learns that somebody is signed in and cannot become them.

/**
 * The two records a browser session needs to outlive a request, and the contract
 * an adapter implements.
 *
 * ## Why this is a table, when an access token is not
 *
 * The MCP endpoint's access tokens are deliberately signed and stateless: it is
 * the hot path, it must give the same answer on every instance, and it therefore
 * accepts the one cost of that choice — a minted token cannot be withdrawn before
 * it expires. A browser session cannot accept that cost, for three reasons, and
 * each one on its own would be enough:
 *
 *   - **Signing out has to mean something.** A signed cookie can only be
 *     forgotten, never revoked, so a copy taken before signing out would keep
 *     working. Here the row is deleted and the credential is dead.
 *   - **The access list has to keep applying.** A closed beta whose operator
 *     removes an address should not leave that browser reading somebody's taste
 *     model for days. The address is on the row, so every request can re-ask.
 *   - **Nothing about a page render needs statelessness.** It already runs
 *     several queries against this database; one more indexed probe is free,
 *     where on the MCP path it would be the only query there is.
 *
 * ## What a session is allowed to hold
 *
 * The user key, the verified address, and two timestamps. Not a profile, not a
 * Google token — Google's token response is verified and dropped inside
 * `lib/oauth/google.ts` and never reaches this module — and no history of what
 * was looked at. The address is here because the signed-in page names it and because
 * the access list is re-checked against it; it goes when the session goes.
 *
 * ## Two tables, because there are two lifetimes
 *
 * A sign-in in progress lives for minutes and is spent once; a session lives for
 * days and is presented on every request. They also fail differently: an
 * unresumable login is a person who has to press the button again, an unusable
 * session is a person who has to sign in again.
 *
 * Neither table is `oauth_pending_logins`. That record carries a client, a
 * redirect URI, a code challenge and a resource, none of which a browser sign-in
 * has, and mixing them would mean one handler holding both kinds of state — where
 * the failure mode is a browser sign-in redeemed as an MCP authorization code.
 */

/**
 * A browser sign-in parked while the user is at Google.
 *
 * `browserBinding` is what makes the `state` Google echoes back evidence of
 * anything. Without it, a `state` that an attacker started their own sign-in to
 * obtain could be handed to a victim's browser, which would complete it and end up
 * holding a session for the attacker's account — or the attacker could complete a
 * `state` they obtained from somebody else's browser. The cookie is the thing
 * neither of them can supply.
 *
 * The MCP flow binds both of its pauses the same way and for the same reason; see
 * `lib/oauth/flow-binding.ts`, which argues it at length.

 * How long each record lives.
 *
 * Ten minutes for a sign-in in progress, the same as an authorization in
 * progress: a real person is signing in during it, and nothing about a browser
 * sign-in takes longer than one at an MCP client.
 *
 * Seven days for a session, as an absolute expiry rather than an idle timeout
 * that slides. A week is short enough that an abandoned laptop stops being a way
 * in fairly soon and long enough that a beta tester is not signing in daily; and
 * absolute means the privacy page can state one number that is true, rather than
 * "seven days from whenever you last looked", which is not a period anyone can
 * check. Signing in again is one button and mints a fresh week.

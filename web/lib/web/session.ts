 * Who is signed in to this browser — the one way anything on the website asks.
 *
 * Every authenticated page resolves the visitor through this function and through
 * nothing else, and it takes exactly one argument: the value of a cookie. There
 * is no parameter for a user, an owner, an account or an address, so a page cannot
 * be written that reads whose data to show from a URL, a query string, a form
 * field or a request body. That is the tenant-isolation mechanism on the web side,
 * and it is a shape rather than a rule to remember — the same argument as
 * `tasteStore(user)`, which is the only thing this result is then handed to.

/**
 * A signed-in visitor: the owner, and the address to show them.
 *
 * `user` is the canonical Tonight identity, byte for byte the same value an
 * MCP access token's subject carries for the same Google account — both are
 * `identityFromClaims`' provider-qualified subject, minted from the same identity
 * token by the same code. So a browser and an MCP client authenticated with one
 * Google account are one owner, and the site shows the taste model `get_taste`
 * returns because it reads it through the same store.
 *
 * `email` is for the person looking at the page, so they can see which of their
 * Google accounts this is. It is never an input to anything: nothing keys, scopes
 * or authorises on it.

/**
 * Resolves a session cookie, or returns null.
 *
 * Null means "not signed in", and it deliberately covers every way of not being:
 * no cookie, a value that matches no row, an expired session, and an account the
 * access list no longer admits. Callers have one thing to do about all four —
 * offer a sign-in — and collapsing them here is what stops a caller from
 * accidentally treating one of them as authenticated.
 *
 * An account that has left the access list has its session **deleted** on the way
 * to that answer, rather than merely refused. A closed beta's operator removing
 * an address should end that browser's access, not leave a row that would work
 * again if the address were re-added; and the row is the only thing keeping the
 * address, so removing it is also the tidier answer for the person removed.
 *
 * A database failure is not caught here. It is not an authentication answer and
 * must not be turned into one: "signed out" would send someone round a sign-in
 * loop that cannot succeed, and "signed in" would be a great deal worse. The
 * caller decides what a page does when the database is unreachable.

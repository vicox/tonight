/**
 * Signing a person in to tonight.movie, and out again.
 *
 *     POST /auth/signin    park a sign-in, bind it to this browser  ─►  Google
 *     GET  /auth/callback  Google returns  ─►  session cookie       ─►  /
 *     POST /auth/signout   delete the session, forget the cookie    ─►  /
 *
 * This is authentication of a human in a browser, and it is deliberately a
 * separate thing from the OAuth flow under `/oauth`, which is an MCP client
 * asking a user to authorize it. The two share what they should — one identity
 * provider, one access list, one canonical user identity, one deployment
 * configuration, one PKCE implementation, one database — and share nothing else.
 * Neither can produce the other's credential: this flow cannot mint an
 * authorization code, and the OAuth flow cannot mint a session cookie, because
 * they read and write different tables and there is no branch between them.
 *
 * ## Why both endpoints that a page reaches are POST
 *
 * Starting a sign-in and signing out are both `POST`, and both refuse a request
 * whose `Origin` is not this deployment's. `SameSite=Lax` already means a
 * cross-site form post carries no cookie, so a forged sign-out could not end
 * anybody's session; the `Origin` check is the belt to that braces, and it is what
 * makes "another site cannot start or end a session here" true without depending
 * on a browser having honoured a cookie attribute. Starting a sign-in through a
 * GET would additionally mean a link, a prefetch or an image tag could set a
 * cookie and consume a rate-limit budget on a visitor's behalf.
 */

 * Starts a sign-in.
 *
 * Never short-circuits when a session already exists, on purpose: pressing sign
 * in while signed in is how somebody switches Google account, and answering it
 * with "you are already signed in" would make the account they are trying to
 * leave the one they are stuck with.

/**
 * The little any store here needs from a database.
 *
 * Deliberately smaller than any real client's API, so that adding an adapter is
 * a day's work rather than a port and nothing above it can reach for a
 * driver-specific feature.
 *
 * `query` and `exec` are separate because the wire protocol separates them.
 * `query` carries bound parameters, which makes it a prepared statement and
 * therefore exactly one command — every value a store handles goes through it,
 * always bound and never interpolated. `exec` runs a multi-statement script with
 * no parameters, which is what a migration is; putting DDL through `query`
 * fails, and putting a parameter through `exec` is impossible, so the split
 * keeps both honest.

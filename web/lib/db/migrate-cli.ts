/**
 * `npm run db:migrate` — brings every schema in the database up to date.
 *
 * **In production this is the only thing that migrates.** An instance opening a
 * store checks that the migrations its code needs have been applied and raises a
 * configuration error if any are missing; it runs no DDL of its own. So a missed
 * run *is* an outage there, and the order is fixed: migrate, confirm, then deploy
 * the build that needs it. See `prepareSchema` in ./migrate.ts for why a request
 * from the internet must never be what changes a schema.
 *
 * Outside production, opening a store still migrates, so a checkout needs no
 * separate step — but only this command can be placed in a deploy.
 *
 * Idempotent and safe to run concurrently: see `migrate` for how the tracking
 * table's own primary key does that without a lock.

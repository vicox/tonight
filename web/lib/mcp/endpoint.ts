/**
 * The MCP endpoint: one authorization boundary, then the server.
 *
 *     request
 *        ↓  Origin allowed?                    403 if not
 *        ↓  Bearer token valid for /mcp?       401 if not, 403 if under-scoped
 *        ↓  AuthenticatedUser
 *        ↓  MCP server bound to that user
 *      tool
 *
 * Everything above the last line happens once, here. A tool never sees a
 * header, a token or a claim — it is handed a server that already knows whose
 * session it is. That is deliberate and structural rather than a convention to
 * remember: `tonightMcpServer` cannot be called without an
 * `AuthenticatedUser`, so a future tool that forgets to check who is calling
 * does not compile, let alone answer.
 *
 * A missing token is not an anonymous user. There is no such thing here: the
 * gate answers 401 and the factory below never runs, so no code path exists in
 * which a tool has no one to attribute a request to.
 *
 * Kept apart from `app/mcp/route.ts` so that the boundary is testable as a
 * plain function of a `Request` — which is what the tests in this directory
 * exercise — and so the route stays thin enough to hold no logic worth testing.
